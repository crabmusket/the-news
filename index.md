# The News

Now that The News has been banned from Australia's most important public forum*, we must take matters into our own hands and get The News ourselves! Roll up your sleeves, put your investigative hat on, and prepare to free your mind and your news feed.

*The News is [back now][]. But in the opinion of the editor, our Patented Seven-Step Process to Free Your Mind and Your News Feed is still a beneficial treatment for all consumers of News.

## How to get The News

1. Download [the-news.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crabmusket/the-news/main/the-news.xml) to your computer (right-click, "save link as")
2. Download an [RSS reader program](#rss-reading-software), or subscribe to an [online RSS reader](#online-rss-services) service ([what is RSS?](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-rss-feed-4684568))
3. Find an option to "Import an OPML file" ([what is an OPML file?](https://www.lifewire.com/opml-file-2622105))
4. Select `the-news.xml` which you downloaded in step 1
5. Read the news!
6. Delete sites you're not interested in
7. Add more sites! You may want to install a [browser extension](#browser-extensions) to help you find RSS feeds while browsing the web

The [list of default news sources](#whats-in-the-default-bundle) is biased towards my own tastes and opinions, so you may find it disagreeable. Steps **six** and **seven** address this unfortunate reality. However, for more technologically savvy readers, I welcome pull requests to amend and expand the default list.

## FAQ

### Why would I want to take part in this miracle seven-step process?

Consuming The News via RSS feeds gives _you_ the power rather than allowing a platform to determine what you see.

### Why seven, seven is too many?

No pain, no gain! But in all seriousness, you might be a more casual consumer of The News; you may not need an intravenous drip of piping hot News delivered to you every minute of the day. That's totally okay, and probably actually a good thing. In that case, you can ignore all seven of the steps and simply proceed with your day.

You can keep watching The News on TV, listening to podcasts (which also use RSS, just sayin'), or even picking up the paper from your local Newsagent. You can even visit News websites directly, one after the other (or open up like 50 tabs at the same time, if that's your thing).

On the other hand, if you set up an RSS reader, you can use it to consume blogs and other things which are not necessarily News-worthy, but nevertheless are of interest to your good self!

### What's in the default bundle?

After completing step **four** of our patented Process, you'll be able to read The News from Australia's most trusted News organisations.

- First among equals is, of course, the ABC
- There's a dedicated health section with government and ABC updates
- I've included some other prominent Australian media companies like The Guardian
- There are some international sources like the BBC
- I've added smaller mastheads like The Saturday Paper and Reneweconomy (energy is important!)
- Aaaand there's even some satire (at least, I _think_ it's satire?)

### There is too much News! Make it stop!

RSS feeds from large publishers like the national News organisations can indeed be a lot to take in.
If your RSS reader supports customisation, try adjusting what tags you see.

Good News Organisations&trade; will publish a variety of different feeds based on topic.
The Guardian, for example, is [very good at this](https://www.theguardian.com/help/feeds).

### Why are so many RSS readers so crap?

I don't know, and it makes me sad. But I have been pretty happy with [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com).
I'd love to find a good pice of desktop software though. Let me know if you find one.

### How can I do that?

Probably [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/crabmusket).

# The News

Now that there is no more The News allowed on Australia's most important public forum, we must take matters into our own hands and get The News ourselves! Roll up your sleeves, put your investigative hat on, and prepare to free your mind and your news feed.

## How to get The News

1. Download [the-news.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crabmusket/the-news/main/the-news.xml) to your computer (right-click, "save link as")
2. Download an [RSS reader program](#rss-reading-software), or subscribe to an [online RSS reader](#online-rss-services) service ([what is RSS?](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-rss-feed-4684568))
3. Find an option to "Import an OPML file" ([what is an OPML file?](https://www.lifewire.com/opml-file-2622105))
4. Select `the-news.xml` which you downloaded in step 1
5. Read the news!
6. Delete sites you're not interested in
7. Add more sites! You may want to install a [browser extension](#browser-extensions) to help you find RSS feeds while browsing the web

The [list of default news sources](#whats-in-the-default-bundle) is biased towards my own tastes and opinions, so you may find it disagreeable. Steps **six** and **seven** address this unfortunate reality. However, for more technologically savvy readers, I welcome pull requests to amend and expand the default list.

## RSS reading software

- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)
- Microsoft Outlook (allegedly)

## FAQ

### Why would I want to take part in this miracle seven-step process?

Consuming news via RSS feeds gives _you_ the power rather than allowing a platform to determine what you see.

### Why seven, seven is too many?

No pain, no gain! But in all seriousness, you may be a more casual consumer of news: you may not need an intravenous drip of piping hot News delivered to you in this way. That's totally okay, and probably actually a good thing. You can still use RSS to consume blogs and other things of interest to yourself - or you can keep watching the news on TV, listening to podcasts (which also use RSS, just sayin'), or even picking up the paper from your local newsagent.

### What's in the default bundle?

After completing step **four** of our patented Process, you'll be able to read the news from Australia's most trusted news organisations.
The first among equals is, of course, the ABC. I've included some other prominent Australiam media companies like The Guardian.
There are some international sources like the BBC, smaller mastheads like The Saturday Paper, and even some satire (at least, I _think_ it's satire).

### There is too much news! Make it stop!

RSS feeds from large publishers like the national news organisations can indeed be a lot to take in.
If your reader supports customisation, try adjusting what tags you see.

Good News Organisations&trade; will publish a variety of different feeds based on topic.
The Guardian, for example, is [very good at this](https://www.theguardian.com/help/feeds).

### Why are so many RSS readers so crap?

I don't know, and it makes me sad. But I have been pretty happy with [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com).
I'd love to find a good pice of desktop software though. Let me know if you find one.

### How can I do that?

Probably [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/crabmusket).
